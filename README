ThreadWeaver examples.

HelloWorld shows the most simple ThreadWeaver application. There are two versions, one that queues a raw pointer to a job that
is held as a stack variable, and one that queues a JobPointer, which is a shared pointer.

SequenceDemo shows how sequences can be used to model program flows. It will retrieve the latest post and blog title from
fickedinger.tumblr.org. On success, it will display data in the main window. If no network is available, the retriever job
will fail, and the parser job will be dequeued (the abort-on-failure feature built into sequences).
